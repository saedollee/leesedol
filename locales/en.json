    "about.content": "Lee Sedol embarked on his professional Go career in 2002 and went on to secure more than 18 major international titles over two decades, earning him the reputation of a living legend in the world of Go. In 2012, he became only the second player in history to reach 1,000 career victories. Four years later, he made headlines by claiming a single game win in the five–match series against DeepMind’s AlphaGo, a feat that marked a turning point in both Go and artificial intelligence. Upon his retirement in 2018, Professor Lee joined UNIST’s Department of Artificial Intelligence, where he has integrated the principles of move‑reading and positional judgment—honed at the Go board—into cutting‑edge AI research and education. He has also designed and produced strategy board games inspired by his Go expertise, and continues to collaborate with leading international academic circles on a forthcoming paper titled “A Decade of Change: Go and AI.” Beyond academia, Professor Lee is a sought‑after speaker at global conferences, sharing insights on strategic problem‑solving and human–machine collaboration with audiences around the world.",
